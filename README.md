🙋‍♂️ I am Gavin McClure-Coleman, a Computer Science student at Gonzaga University. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor in Computer Science and Computational Thinking and am on track to graduate in 2028.

👨‍💻 I’m especially interested in cybersecurity and have found myself intrigued by the offensive security side of it, diving into all kinds of CTFs, and learning as much as possible about penetration testing.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to use:
- C++
- Python
