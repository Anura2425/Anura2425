🙋‍♂️ I am Gavin McClure-Coleman, a Computer Science student at Gonzaga University. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Computational Thinking with a concentration in cybersecurity and am on track to graduate in 2028.

👨‍💻 I’m especially interested in cybersecurity and have found myself intrigued by both offensive and defensive aspects of the field! Recently, I have been most interested in learning about penetration testing, cryptography, and some reverse engineering!

🌳 I mainly like to program in the languages:

- C++ (and C)
- Python

🌱 And I just started learning:

- Rust
